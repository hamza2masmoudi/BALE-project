## Paper
**BALE: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Bilingual Contract Risk Assessment**
Hamza Masmoudi (Independent Researcher)
### Abstract
Commercial contract review remains a critical bottleneck in legal practice. We present BALE, a neuro-symbolic framework that combines fine-tuned large language models with rule-based risk scoring for automated contract analysis. Trained on 75,382 real legal examples from 10 diverse sources, BALE achieves 97.8% accuracy on clause type classification and 65.9% on risk level detection—a 21-point improvement over model-only baselines.
### Key Results
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Clause Type Accuracy | 97.8% |
| Risk Detection Accuracy | 65.9% |
| Improvement over Baseline | +21% |
